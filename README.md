Hello, all.
This is my first GitHub repository as part of The Odin Project.

Perhaps the most challenging part of this project was making Git a regular part of my workflow; I've coded a bit of html before but using Git alongside my projects is new to me as a beginner. Memorizing the commands and figuring out shortcuts will be in my best interest.
I also found it a bit challenging keeping track of my href attributes and figuring out how to link elements in other directories. All in all however, this project was a very fulfilling and effective way to learn more about both HTML and Git.
